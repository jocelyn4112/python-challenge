# python-challenge

Full disclosure, I have had a myriad of computer issues and have spent 20+ hours getting all of the programs for the course and running correctly on my laptop with the help of the instructor and TAs. Finally, I prevailed but was not able to follow along with all of the in class examples for a few classes due to troubleshooting with a TA. 
I did go back and watch the lectures, however not having a background in coding, I really struggled with this assignment and have put many hours into it. Pandas is far more intuitive for me and already makes more sense. I met with a tutor, attended office hours and utilized all resources available. I have spent hours on this and can not spend any more time. The files are outputting to a text file sporadically and will not print properly. I have no idea at this point. I fully realize this is all part of the learning process, however I am very frustrated right now and know this needs to be submitted. In retrospect, two days ago I should have just started over.  Any leniency in grading would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!
